## üëã Introduction

**Leon** is an **open-source personal assistant** who can live **on your server**.

He **does stuff** when you **ask him to**.

You can **talk to him** and he can **talk to you**.
You can also **text him** and he can also **text you**.
If you want to, Leon can communicate with you by being **offline to protect your privacy**.

### Why?

> 1. If you are a developer (or not), you may want to build many things that could help in your daily life.
>    Instead of building a dedicated project for each of those ideas, Leon can help you with his
>    Skills structure.
> 2. With this generic structure, everyone can create their own skills and share them with others.
>    Therefore there is only one core (to rule them all).
> 3. Leon uses AI concepts, which is cool.
> 4. Privacy matters, you can configure Leon to talk with him offline. You can already text with him without any third party services.
> 5. Open source is great.

### What is this repository for?

> This repository contains the following nodes of Leon:
>
> - The server
> - Skills
> - The web app
> - The hotword node
> - The TCP server (for inter-process communication between Leon and third-party processes such as spaCy)
> - The Python bridge (the connector between Python core and skills)

### What is Leon able to do?

> Today, the most interesting part is about his core and the way he can scale up. He is pretty young but can easily scale to have new features (skills).
> You can find what he is able to do by browsing the [skills list](https://github.com/leon-ai/leon/tree/develop/skills).<br>
> Please do know that after the official release, we will build many skills along with the community. Feel free to [join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/MNQqqKg) to be part of the journey.

You can also contribute by [sponsoring Leon](http://sponsor.getleon.ai).

Please note that I dedicate most of my free time to Leon.

By sponsoring the project you make the project sustainable and faster to develop features.

The focus is not only limited to the activity you see on GitHub but also a lot of thinking about the direction of the project. Which is naturally related to the overall design, architecture, vision, learning process and so on...
