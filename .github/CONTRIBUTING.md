The commit message guideline is adapted from the [AngularJS Git Commit Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines).

### Types

Types define which kind of changes you made to the project.

| Types    | Description                                                                                              |

| chore    | Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools such as changelog generation. No production code change. |
| ci       | Changes related to continuous integration only (GitHub Actions, CircleCI, etc.).                         |
| docs     | Documentation only changes.                                                                              |

### Scopes

Scopes define high-level nodes of Leon.

- bridge/python
- bridge/nodejs
- docker
- hotword
- scripts
- server
- tcp server
- web app
- skill/skill_name

### Examples

```sh
git commit -m "feat(server): awesome new server feature"
git commit -m "docs(skill/leon): fix spelling"
git commit -m "chore: split training script into awesome blocks"
git commit -m "style(web app): remove chatbot useless parentheses"
```

## Sponsor

You can also contribute by [sponsoring Leon](http://sponsor.getleon.ai).

Please note that I dedicate most of my free time to Leon.

By sponsoring the project you make the project sustainable and faster to develop features.

The focus is not only limited to the activity you see on GitHub but also a lot of thinking about the direction of the project. Which is naturally related to the overall design, architecture, vision, learning process and so on...

## Contributing to the Python Bridge or TCP HttpServer

Leon makes use of two binaries, the Python bridge and the TCP server. These binaries are compiled from Python sources.

The Python bridge is used to communicate between the core and skills made with Python.

The TCP server is used to communicate between the core and third-party nodes, such as spaCy.

### Set Up the Python Environment

To contribute to these parts, you need to set up a Python environment running with a specific Python version and a specific Pipenv version.

It is recommended to use Pyenv to manage your Python versions.

If you are on GNU/Linux Ubuntu, you can run the following to install Pyenv, otherwise, please refer to the [Pyenv documentation to install it](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation):

```bash
# Update registry
sudo apt-get update

# Install Pyenv deps
sudo apt-get install make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev \
libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm \
libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev

# Install Pyenv
curl https://pyenv.run | bash

# Add output lines to .bashrc

# Restart shell
exec "$SHELL"
```

Once Pyenv installed, run:

```bash
# Install Python
pyenv install 3.9.10 --force
pyenv global 3.9.10

# Install Pipenv
pip install pipenv==2022.7.24
```

Your Python environment should be ready now. So now you can set up the respective environments according to what you are going to contribute to and build them:

```bash
# Set up the Python bridge environment
npm run setup:python-bridge

# Set up the TCP server environment
npm run setup:tcp-server
# If you are in China, you can run this to download models faster:
npm run setup:tcp-server cn

# Once your code changes are done, you can build via:

# Build the Python bridge
npm run build:python-bridge

# Build the TCP server
npm run build:tcp-server

# Run the Python bridge
./bridges/python/dist/{OS-CPU_ARCH}/leon-python-bridge server/src/intent-object.sample.json

# Run the TCP server
./tcp_server/dist/{OS-CPU_ARCH}/leon-tcp-server en
```
